Basic Linux Privilege Escalation
g0tmi1k
12-15 minutes

Before starting, I would like to point out - I'm no expert. As far as I know, there isn't a "magic" answer, in this huge area. This is simply my finding, typed up, to be shared (my starting point). Below is a mixture of commands to do the same thing, to look at things in a different place or just a different light. I know there more "things" to look for. It's just a basic & rough guide. Not every command will work for each system as Linux varies so much. "It" will not jump off the screen - you've to hunt for that "little thing" as "the devil is in the detail".
Enumeration is the key.

(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:

    Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
    Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
    Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
    Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
    Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.

Mitigations
Is any of the above information easy to find?

Try doing it! Setup a cron job which automates script(s) and/or 3rd party products
Is the system fully patched?

Kernel, operating system, all applications, their plugins and web services

apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
yum update

Are services running with the minimum level of privileges required?

For example, do you need to run MySQL as root?
Scripts Can any of this be automated?!
